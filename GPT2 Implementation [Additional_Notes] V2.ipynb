The class takes in a pattern for filenames, parameters for batch size (`B`), sequence length (`T`), and information about the process' rank and the total number of processes involved in the training.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Parameters Initialization**: You need to know your batch size (`B`), sequence length (`T`), your process rank (`process_rank`), and the total number of processes (`num_processes`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Functions**:\n",
        "   - `reset()`: This method initializes or resets the data loader to start from the first shard and adjusts the position of the current batch based on the process rank.\n",
        "   - `advance()`: This method moves the loader to the next shard and resets the position for batch extraction.\n",
        "   - `next_batch()`: This method extracts a batch of data from the current shard and moves the position pointer. It returns two tensors, `x` and `y`, where `x` is your input data and `y` is the target data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s a simple example to utilize this data loader:\n",

        "- **Custom vs. Standard**: `.bin` might be used if the data needs to be in a specific format that isn't directly supported by standard formats like `.npy`. For instance, certain frameworks or proprietary systems may use `.bin` to ensure compatibility or performance optimizations specific to that system.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Using `.bin` provides flexibility to structure the content exactly how the application needs it without any overhead that standard formats might impose.\n",
